🛠️ Form Validator: Keeping Data Clean and Reliable

A form validator is a tool or mechanism—often a piece of code—used to verify that the data entered into a form meets specific criteria before it's processed or stored. Think of it as a security guard that checks credentials at the door to make sure everything's in order.

✨ Key Functions of a Form Validator:
Ensures Required Fields Are Filled: Blocks submission if essential fields like name or email are empty.

Checks Data Format: Validates that entries like email addresses, phone numbers, or dates follow the correct patterns.

Prevents Invalid Input: Filters out unwanted characters (e.g. symbols in a name field).

Confirms Logical Consistency: Verifies that data makes sense together—like a start date isn’t after an end date.

Provides User Feedback: Shows helpful error messages so users can correct their input right away.
